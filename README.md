# Markdown-for-beginners

Markdown is a simplified markup language that uses different syntax than HTML to achieve similar formatting results, such as using /*#/ for '<h1>' headings.

In markdown you write:

```markdown
  # This is a heading
```
 Whereas in HTML you write:

```html
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
```
