# Markdown-for-beginners

## What is markdown?

Markdown is a simplified markup language that uses different syntax than HTML to achieve similar formatting results, such as using \'#' for ```<h1>``` headings. This language is normally used for things such as blogs and GitHub.

### How to use it

To make a heading you add a \'#' before the sentence.

```markdown
  # This is a heading
```

To make it smaller you add multiple hashtags before the sentence.

```markdown
  ## This is a heading
  ### This is a heading
  #### This is a heading
  ##### This is a heading
  ###### This is a heading
```
